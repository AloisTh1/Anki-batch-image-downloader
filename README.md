# Batch Image downloader

An addon to batch download images from internet.
I recommend using a vpn to not get ip-banned from the querying services. (IDK if this is possible)

## Video and tutorial (still read steps below pls)

Usage is simple :

- Go to the deck you want to add images to
- Open the deck browser (button "browse")
- Select 1+ card WITH THE SAME FIELDS NAME, right click or open the "card" menu on the top left
- Select "Add images"
- In the dialog window, customize what you want to do (atm there's not a lot of options supported)
- Nb of images if the number of images you want to add per note
- Source field is what the add on will query, destination field is where the image will be added
- Be very cautious with the "overwrite" option

> I didn't test every languages, but french and english seems to work well.
